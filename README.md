# OtakuNeo-Bot (Open-Sourced)

Once was originally a private repo, I decided to make it open sourced because why not. This bot comes packed full with features such as:

- Moderation
- Utility
- Anime
- Roleplay
- Fun, etc.

If you have forked or cloned this repo, please make sure to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To run the bot, replace the process.env.(DJS_TOKEN) with your own. Then either run the included .bat file or do this in console:

```
node .
```

or

```
node index.js
```

That's done. Have fun with it.
